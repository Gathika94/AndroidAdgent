# SenseMe - sample device type for IOTS 3.0

SenseMe has an Arduino agent to measure temperature values using a DHT11 sensor and swich on/off LED light according to the commands given by the server.

Purpose of the sample is to illustrate connecting devices to the IOTS via MQTT 

#Instructions
- Move this sample to <IoTS_HOME>/samples/<Sample name>
- Copy <Sample name>-deployer.xml to <IoTS_HOME>/samples/
- Run mvn clean install -f <Sample name>-deployer.xml to deploy sample
- Create new device of SenseMe type and burn the downloaded arduino code to a NodeMCU board
- Attach a DHT11 sensor and an LED to NodeMCU (pin numbers are specified in Arduino code)
- Send "ON" "OFF" commands respectively from IOTS to switch ON/OFF the light
- Real-time and batch analytics graphs views will be generated by temperature data published by NodeMCU
